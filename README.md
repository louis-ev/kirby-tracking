*A tiny plugin for local traffic analytics in Kirby CMS.*

Kirby tracking uses javascript events to identify each visitor with device information and logs all its subsequent events in a page directly accessible through the panel.

## Installation

Use one of the alternatives below.

### 1. Kirby CLI

If you are using the [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli) you can install this plugin by running the following commands in your shell:

```
$ cd path/to/kirby
$ kirby plugin:install louis-ev/kirby-tracking
```

### 2. Clone or download

1. [Clone](https://github.com/louis-ev/kirby-tracking.git) or [download](https://github.com/louis-ev/kirby-tracking/archive/master.zip)  this repository.
2. Unzip the archive if needed and rename the folder to `plugin-name`.

**Make sure that the plugin folder structure looks like this:**

```
site/plugins/kirby-tracking/
```

### 3. Git Submodule

If you know your way around Git, you can download this plugin as a submodule:

```
$ cd path/to/kirby
$ git submodule add https://github.com/louis-ev/kirby-tracking site/plugins/kirby-tracking
```

## Setup

Add the following code to your `footer.php` snippet (or copy its content to your js file):

```php
echo js('assets/plugins/kirby-tracking/assets/js/kirby-tracking.js');
```

Each visit generates a page named with the server's time for the visit, so set the timezone of your site in your `config.php`:

```php
c::set('timezone','Europe/Paris');
```

On first logging event captured, kirby-tracking will check for an existing `kirby-tracking` page. If you already have one and it wasn't created by this plugin, please remove it first or you will get blueprints mismatch and errors.

## Usage

All logs happen in javascript and can be done both with and without a type.
For example, to log a simple page load:

```js
logClientEvents('Page loaded.');
```

For each logged package, the following meta informations will be collected and sent:
- browser — name of browser and version 
- device — client's user agent
- event_page — type from which the event originated (with site url automatically replaced with ~)
- event_type — js string sent to logClientEvents (with site url automatically replaced with ~)
- lang — lang of browser
- window_size : browser innerWidth and innerHeight

## Options

### Disable logged-in users tracking

You can disable tracking for logged-in users in the `tracking` page in the panel. If tracking for logged-in users isn’t disabled, they will be identified with the name `admin`.

### Disable bots tracking

You can disable tracking for bots in the `tracking` page in the panel. Bots tracking is made using the browser's user agent and matching it with the following RegExp: "/Googlebot|MJ12bot|yandexbot|Google Page Speed Insights|crawler|spider|robot|crawling|baidu|bing|msn|duckduckgo|teoma|slurp|yandex|Coda,/i".
